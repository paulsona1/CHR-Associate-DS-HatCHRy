This analysis constructs classifiers for our inferential target, CurrentCondition - a factor variable indicating order status. In this most initial section, I import the provided data and inpsect the levels of the target variable. I observe seven non-missing levels, which are highly unbalanced. In particular, approximately 60% of the orders have condition status "Accepted", compared to .05% of the orders having condition statuts "Waiting On Recommendation". The unbalance informs our selection of reasonable classification methods. For example, I hesitate to use support vector machines because designing weighting contrasts without much domain knowledge is probably ill-conceived. There are 16,156,315 rows in the data and 15 columns (after removing the intelligence-free row counter column).

Now, do some exploratory data analysis. We begin by assessing the possibility of duplication within the orders data. We find a single duplicate request_id, corresponding to request_id **f0293ccd87b445f5989c6c68726608dc**. On inspection of these duplicate request_id, they appear to be true duplicates, so I remove one of the duplicates, keeping the other. 

I proceed by identifying missingness in the features. I find four columns having incomplete cases: (1) order_distance, (2) order_origin_weight, (3) rate_norm and (4) est_cost_norm. On inspection of some samples of rows with these missing features, I assume that these data are missing at random. In any case, the missingness is rare and will probably not sway our analysis.
